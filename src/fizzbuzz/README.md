Download:

  download the code base, in the following structure:
    src/fizznuzz/*


 Run:
    cd src/;
    groovy fizzbuzz/FizzBuzz.groovy.

    It will print out the numbers for both stage 1 and stage 2. Since it is a long list, be sure to scroll up to find
    proper section for the two stages.
